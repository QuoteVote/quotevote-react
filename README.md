# Quote Vote

Quote.Vote is a text-first platform for public dialogue,  
where every post becomes a space for quoting, reflecting, and voting on ideas.  

Contributors from around the world helped build this civic engagement toolâ€”  
without ads or algorithms, we can have transparent conversation.  

Features such as targeted feedback via text highlights, public chat threads,  
and voting mechanics support thoughtful interaction over reactive engagement.  

Originally prototyped as Scoreboard, the project is now in preparation for open-source  
and our team welcomes remix, reuse, and contributions from developers, designers,  
and democratic technologists alike.

## GraphQL API Documentation

The Quote Vote platform uses GraphQL for efficient data fetching and mutations.

---

### Input Types

**PostInput**
```graphql
input PostInput {
  content: String!
  subscoreboardId: ID!
  media: [Upload]      # Optional, for images/files
  title: String        # Optional, if posts have titles
  visibility: String   # "public", "private", or "restricted"
  allowComments: Boolean
  scheduledAt: DateTime
}
```

**CommentInput**
```graphql
input CommentInput {
  postId: ID!
  parentCommentId: ID   # Optional, for threaded replies
  content: String!
}
```

**QuotePostInput**
```graphql
input QuotePostInput {
  sourcePostId: ID!
  quotedText: String!
  quotingPostContent: String!
}
```

---

### Error Handling

- All errors are returned in the standard GraphQL `errors` array.
- Each error object contains:
  - `message`: Human-readable error message.
  - `code`: Application-specific error code (e.g., `UNAUTHORIZED`, `NOT_FOUND`, `VALIDATION_ERROR`).
  - `path`: The path in the query where the error occurred.
- Example error response:
  ```json
  {
    "errors": [
      {
        "message": "You must be logged in to perform this action.",
        "code": "UNAUTHORIZED",
        "path": ["createPost"]
      }
    ],
    "data": null
  }
  ```
- Validation errors (e.g., missing required fields) are returned with `code: "VALIDATION_ERROR"` and a descriptive message.

---

### Authentication and Authorization

- **Authentication** is handled via JWT (JSON Web Token) in the `Authorization` HTTP header:
  ```
  Authorization: Bearer <token>
  ```
- Users must be authenticated to perform mutations (create posts, comments, votes, etc.) and to access personalized queries (e.g., `feed`, `bookmarks`).
- **Authorization** is enforced at the resolver level:
  - Only the post author can edit or delete their post.
  - Only the comment author can edit or delete their comment.
  - Only authenticated users can upvote, downvote, bookmark, or follow.
  - Restricted posts/subscoreboards are only accessible to permitted users.
- If a user is not authorized, the API returns an error with `code: "FORBIDDEN"`.

---

### Pagination

- Pagination is implemented using the **Relay-style cursor-based** approach for all list queries (e.g., `feed`, `trending`, `comments`).
- Each paginated query accepts:
  - `first` (Int): Number of items to return after the cursor.
  - `after` (String): Cursor to start after.
  - (Optionally) `last` and `before` for reverse pagination.
- The response includes:
  - `edges`: Array of items, each with a `node` (the item) and a `cursor`.
  - `pageInfo`: Object with `hasNextPage`, `hasPreviousPage`, `startCursor`, `endCursor`.
- Example query:
  ```graphql
  query Feed($first: Int, $after: String) {
    feed(first: $first, after: $after) {
      edges {
        node {
          id
          content
          author { id username }
        }
        cursor
      }
      pageInfo {
        hasNextPage
        endCursor
      }
    }
  }
  ```
- This approach ensures efficient loading of large lists and supports infinite scrolling in the UI.

  `git checkout -b dev-feature`  
  for example `dev-eslint-fix`
4. Do your work, check UI, run tests.
5. Make as many commits as you like. After each commit, push the branch back up to origin.
`git push origin dev-branchName`  
As a note, if it's incomplete, add `WIP` to the git commit message first line.  
For example
`WIP Linting files. Linted hssbComponent` 
Rest of git message
6. Once you are done with your work, make sure all test still pass, and that you have linted the files.  
  `npm run lint:check`  
  * Make the adjustments needed so there is no warnings or errors.
  * Ensure you can build without any problems.  
    `npm run build`
7. [Squash your commits](https://github.com/QuoteVote/quotevote-react/wiki/Squashing-Commits) so there is only one.
8. Create your pull request with a descriptive title.  
See the deployed version on the netlify preview build. Wait for code review, feedback, or approval.

  To see the preview build from Netlify, and scroll down to the bottom. Next to where it says "Deploy preview", it says Details. If it's still building, it'll direct you to the netlify log of the build process. Once complete it will show a green check like the example below.
