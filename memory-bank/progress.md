# Quote Vote Project Progress

## Key Decisions & Milestones

*   **[Date]**: Initial Product Requirements Document (PRD) drafted for V1 features based on provided text files.
*   **[Date]**: Decision made to use the existing `voxpop-api` backend (MongoDB/GraphQL) rather than migrating to PostgreSQL or supporting dual databases.
*   **[Date]**: Analysis of the `voxpop-api` backend structure completed.
    *   Directory structure mapped.
    *   GraphQL implementation details (types, resolvers, models) identified.
    *   Mongoose models read and analyzed against PRD requirements.
*   **[Date]**: `architecture.md` created and populated with backend structure overview.
*   **[Date]**: PRD updated with notes comparing requirements to the existing backend implementation.

## Next Steps / To-Do

*   Refine MongoDB models (`resolvers/models/*`) based on analysis and PRD requirements (e.g., add Buddy List, clarify Quote/Comment model usage, standardize naming).
*   Examine key relationship resolvers (`resolvers/relationship/*`) to understand data linking patterns.
*   Examine key mutation/query resolvers (`resolvers/mutations/*`, `resolvers/queries/*`) to understand data access patterns.
*   Begin implementing missing features/refinements identified in the PRD/backend comparison.
*   Define specific tasks for development sprints/iterations.
