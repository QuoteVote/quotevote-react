# Search Page Features

The Search Page has been enhanced with new filtering and sorting capabilities using emoji-based buttons.

## Features

### ðŸ‘¥ Friends Filter
- **Functionality**: Shows posts only from users you follow
- **Usage**: Click the ðŸ‘¥ button to toggle friends-only filtering
- **Visual Indicator**: Button turns blue when active
- **Fallback**: If backend doesn't support native friends filtering, client-side filtering is used

### ðŸ§² Interactions Sorting
- **Functionality**: Sorts posts by total interactions (comments + votes + quotes)
- **Usage**: Click the ðŸ§² button to toggle interaction-based sorting
- **Visual Indicator**: Button turns blue when active
- **Algorithm**: Posts with more interactions appear first

### ðŸ“… Date Range Filter
- **Functionality**: Filter posts by date range
- **Usage**: Click the ðŸ“… button to open date picker
- **Features**: 
  - Select start and end dates
  - Clear dates option
  - Visual indicator when dates are selected
- **Integration**: Works with existing date range filtering in GraphQL queries

## Technical Implementation

### GraphQL Queries
- `GET_TOP_POSTS`: Standard posts query
- `GET_FRIENDS_POSTS`: Posts query with friends filtering support
- Both queries support date range filtering

### State Management
- `filterMode`: Tracks current filter state ('all', 'friends', 'interactions')
- `dateRangeFilter`: Manages date range selection
- Dynamic query selection based on filter mode

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback for unsupported backend features
- Client-side filtering when backend doesn't support friends filtering
- Error policy allows partial results

## UI/UX Features

### Visual Feedback
- Active filters are highlighted in blue
- Hover effects on filter buttons
- Clear status display showing active filters
- Tooltips explaining each filter's purpose

### Responsive Design
- Works on mobile and desktop
- Emoji buttons scale appropriately
- Date picker popover is mobile-friendly

## Future Enhancements

1. **Backend Integration**: Full backend support for friends filtering
2. **Advanced Sorting**: Additional sorting options (newest, oldest, etc.)
3. **Saved Filters**: Remember user's preferred filter settings
4. **Filter Combinations**: Allow multiple filters to be active simultaneously
